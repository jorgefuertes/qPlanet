QUICK INSTALL:
--------------


1.- LATEST VERSION:

        Get the latest version from github:
	
		# svn checkout http://qplanet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ qplanet


2.- SETUP YOUR PLANET:

        All planet's configuration it's in the 'config.yml' file. You must edit it with any utf-8 capable editor, like
        vi, vim, emacs o another typical programer's tool.

        The config file it's very intuitive. You can modify it at you wish, ever preserving the yaml format. We can find
        yaml format reference at:

		- http://www.yaml.org

        We need to respect the identation, it must be ever maked with spaces: NEVER USE TABS TO IDENT YAML FORMAT.

        The options are very clear, and the example configuration it's a real working one from the Hispalinux's[1]
        planet, and you can use it as an start and modify it with your own planet's data and favourite feeds.

        At the 'planets' section, you can add other planets with similar topics, they can be qPlanet or not, to extend
        the culture and knowledge and make a great good to the humanity. 8-)

	
3.- UPLOAD IT TO YOUR WEB SERVER:

        Copy all the files to your web server. Your server only needs to publish the 'htdocs' directory, or the one
        you've defined like 'outdir'.

        You can put all as published, and it cannot means a great security implication, but is very more elegant if the
        server publish just only the necessary, and it is the htdocs directory.

        The Apache or other servers configurarion its out os the bounds of this short text, but this is basically
        telling the server that 'htdocs' it's the "DocumentRoot" at the matter domain.

        In addition to the directory you must copy the program and all the auxiliary files, but this can only be called
        from the system's task scheduler (cron or another).

	
4.- GENERATE YOUR PLANET:

        To generate your planet's first update, execute at his DocumentRoot (not htdocs dir, the previous one):
	
		# php planet.php

        Your server needs to have php5-cli installed, in order to execute console php scripts. In the other hand you
        don't need mod-php or php-cgi because you are going to publish pure html only.

	You may see some errors that you can not get some feeds. You can fix them at the configurarion, delete them or
        retry the execution, because it can be a temporary problem.

        Any other error becomes from the configuration format or may be a bug. Feel free to report it, i'll try to give
        you a hand.


5.- PREVIEW YOUR PLANET:

        Target your navigator to the planet's url and, if all goes ok, you can see the latest posts of all your rss
        feeds.


5.- SETUP A SCHEDULED TASK:

        In order to automagically regenerate the planet contents, you need to setup a server's scheduled task. Any *NIX
        server has a task scheduler like 'cron' at your disposal. Read the system's documentation to see how to setup
        the periodic task.

        At a Debian GNU/Linux server, for example, we can create a 'planet.sh' file at the '/etc/cron.hourly' directory:

		#Â vi /etc/cron.hourly/planet.sh
	
	And write the following in it:
	
		#!/bin/bash

		cd /var/www/planet.mydomain.com
		php planet.php &> last_refresh.log

        Please, replace the 'planet.mydomain.com' by the real domain root directory.

	And give execution permission to this file:
	
		# chmod +x /etc/cron.hourly/planet.sh

        At this point we have the planet updating hourly and generating a fresh contents page.

<END OF INSTALLATION>

THINGS TO SEE AFTER:
	
        You can change the visual theme. All the visual aspect its in:
	
		/htdocs/css/planet.css

        and the gfx, logos an so on at:
	
		/htdocs/gfx

        If you need to change the html core, it is generated by includes and parsing from the parts on:
	
		/html

        Beware about the labels present in the templates, like '${TITLE}'. This labels are parsed by the planet and
        replaced with the appropriated content. If you delete or move a label, nothing serious happens, they are to do
        it, but if you include an unknown label, we have execution errors.

DOUBTS:

        Write me and I can to help you. But you have present this: the computer consultancy it's my job. It's more
        effective try to contract my services. ;-)
